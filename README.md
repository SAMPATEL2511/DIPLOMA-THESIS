# DIPLOMA-THESIS
A mechanical engineering diploma project focused on designing and fabricating a Box Shifting Mechanism for efficient material handling. This mechanism introduces a stop-and-move motion using mechanical linkages, offering advantages over traditional conveyor systems by allowing time delays for inspection or redirection of packages.
